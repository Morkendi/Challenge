# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
This project was created as a refactor challenge, in order to practice what real-life scenarios developers face. The goal of the code is to output the same webpage, but making the code easier to read and easier for the browser to render by combining repeating elements.

Inside HTML and CSS file you will find all changes made to the original starter code, along with comments detailing the reason for said change.
